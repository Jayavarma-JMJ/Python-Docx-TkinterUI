Requirements/Installations:
- Python with venv setup
- PyPI - pip modules - Python-docx (https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/), Tkinter
- Docx template file (The doocument generation part of the python code is hardcoded as per the supplied docx file. More on that below)

Steps executed:  
1. Docx module imports the template file (present in the same directory)
2. Local (present in the same directory) CSV file is read for the SMTP parameters.
3. Tkinter UI is initialized (eg:Text fields for multiline input)
4. Document is generated by populating the document and saved .
5. Mail connections are initialized - SSL or TLS - following which the mail can be sent (SMTP can fail depending on the firewall settings of the organization or the mail providers non-response)
6. From,To,CC, Subject,Body is done using EmailMessage and Attachment is done using the open() and read functions.
